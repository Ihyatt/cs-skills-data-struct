Runtime:
1. When calculating the Big O notation for a particular algorithm, it’s necessary to consider the length of time it takes for the algorithm to run as the algorithm’s workload approaches the size of infinity. What is the workload of a function that takes in a list of integers and returns a new list of the even integers?
	- O(n)

2. Order the following runtimes in ascending order by efficiency as n approaches infinity:

O(1)
O(log n)
O(n)
O(n log n)
O(n^2)
O(2^n)
O(n!)

Stacks and Queues:
1. In the following cases, would a stack or queue be an appropriate data structure?
	1. The process of loading and unloading pallets onto a flatbed truck
		A. Stack
	2. Putting bottle caps on bottles of beer as they roll down an assembly line
		A. Queue
	3. Calculating the solution to this mathematical expression: 2 + (7 * 4) - (3 / 2)
		A. Stack
2. Describe 2 more examples of when a queue would be an appropriate data structure.
	1. Hackbright help Queue
	2. Ordering at a restatuant 
3. Describe 2 more examples of when a stack would be an appropriate data structure.
	1. Eating pancakes
	2. unpacking a suitcase

Linked Lists:
1. Given the below linked list, which are the nodes? What is the data for each node? Where is the head? Where is the tail? (Please be as specific as possible — exactly which parts of the diagram correspond to each part? Arrows? Boxes? Text?)
	a. The nodes are (apple, next), (Berry, next), (Cherry, next)
	b. The data is Apple, Berry, Cherry
	c. Apple is the head because the head is pointing towards it
	d. Cherry is the tail because Berry's next is pointed towards it

2. What’s the difference between a doubly and singly linked list?
	a. A doubly linked list is when a node knows what is before and after it
	b. A singly linked list is where a node is aware of only what is after it

3. Why is it faster to append to a linked list if we keep track of the tail as an attribute?
	a.  Because we don’t have to traverse the list every time we add a node.

Trees:

1.Given the above tree, in what order would a Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm visit each node until finding burrito (starting at food)?
	a.[Food]
	b.[Italian, Indian, Mexican]
	c. [Indian, Mexican, lasagna, pizza]
	d. [Mexican, lasagna, pizza, tikka masala, saag]
	e. [lasagna, pizza, tikka masala, saag, burrito]
	f. [pizza, tikka masala, saag, burrito]
	g. [tikka masala, saag, burrito]
	e. [saag, burrito]
	f. [burrito]
	g. Burrito FOUND! 
	

2.Given the above tree, in what order would a Depth First Search algorithm visit each node until finding Chicago-style (starting at food)?
	a. [Food]
	b. [Italian, Indian, Mexican]
	c. [Italina, Indian, Burrito]
	d. Burrito Found

3. How is a binary search tree different from other trees?
	a. Each node has a right and left child, it also has a rule for arrangement used for fast searching.
